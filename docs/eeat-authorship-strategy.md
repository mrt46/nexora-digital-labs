## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE

The system is designed to answer one fundamental question:

“Why should users and platforms trust this site?”

Trust is not built through artificial authority signals,
but through consistency, transparency, and accountability.

—

## 2. GOOGLE EEAT – SELF-AUDIT FRAMEWORK

EEAT is not a score.
EEAT is a collection of credibility signals.

This checklist must be reviewed per site at least once per month.

## 4. AUTHORSHIP STRATEGY FOR FIRST 3 SITES

### Objective

Present a calm, professional, and accountable publishing identity
without unnecessary risk or artificial realism.

—

### 4.1 Recommended Author Model (First 90 Days)

Primary attribution:
- **By Nexora Editorial Desk**

Optional secondary attribution:
- **By Nexora Research Unit**

Forbidden:
- Individual expert claims
- AI-generated human faces
- Fake personas
- Credential inflation

This model minimizes risk while maintaining clarity.

—

### 4.2 Branding Consistency Model

Each site:
- Has its own domain and name
- Shares the same structural transparency
- Uses consistent editorial language

Shared elements:
- Footer structure
- About page tone
- Editorial methodology

This creates a coherent network without appearing centralized.

—

### 4.3 When Individual Contributors Are Introduced

Individual contributor profiles are optional and never mandatory.

Conditions:
- Site stability (6+ months)
- Consistent traffic
- Clear benefit to users

Contributor profiles must:
- Be transparently labeled as editorial roles
- Avoid expert or advisor claims
- Use abstract or non-human avatars

—

## 5. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN PRACTICES

The following practices are permanently disallowed:

- AI-generated photorealistic human faces
- Fake LinkedIn or professional histories
- “X years of experience” claims without verification
- Health or financial expert positioning

These practices introduce disproportionate long-term risk.

—

## 6. STRATEGIC SUMMARY

First 90 days:
- Corporate authorship
- Minimal identity surface
- Maximum transparency

Future expansion:
- Optional contributor roles
- No dependency on individual personas

—

## 7. FINAL PRINCIPLE

Trust is earned through structure, not simulation.

The Nexora system prioritizes:
- Stability over speed
- Transparency over appearance
- Longevity over short-term gains
