# Website Brand Discovery & Approval Pipeline
## Agent-Driven, Legally-Aware Naming System

This document defines the mandatory pipeline used to discover, evaluate,
score, and approve website names.

Humans do not research.
Humans do not compare.
Humans only approve.

---

## Core Principle

> Decision-making is automated.  
> Accountability is documented.  
> Human involvement is limited to approval.

---

## End-to-End Pipeline

Brand Discovery Agent ↓ Domain Ownership Agent ↓ Trademark Check Agent ↓ Legal Risk & Compliance Agent ↓ Real-World Usage Risk Agent ↓ Brand Scoring Engine ↓ Governance Decision ↓ Human Approval ↓ Domain Purchase

No step is optional.  
No step can be skipped.

## Brand Scoring Engine

All candidates are scored numerically.

| Criterion | Weight |
|---|---|
| Brandability | 20% |
| Domain Availability | 20% |
| Trademark Risk | 25% |
| Legal Risk | 20% |
| Usage Confusion Risk | 15% |

Trademark and legal risks carry the highest combined weight.

## Governance Decision

Governance reviews:
- scores
- risk summaries
- legal notes

Possible outcomes:
- APPROVE
- REJECT
- REQUEST ALTERNATIVES

---

## Human Approval

Humans are presented with:
- top 1–3 candidates
- final scores
- short risk summary

Human action:
- APPROVE
- REJECT

No modification is allowed at this stage.

---

## Domain Purchase

Domain acquisition is performed manually by a human
after governance and human approval.

This ensures:
- legal accountability
- clear ownership
- exit readiness
