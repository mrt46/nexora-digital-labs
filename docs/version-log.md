## v1.4.0 – Site Experience & Quality Intelligence Layer

Date: 2026-01-05

Added:
- Site Experience Critic Agent (UX & flow-focused)
- UX Pattern Memory Agent (long-term good/bad design memory)
- Site Experience Comparator Agent (cross-site UX benchmarking)
- Experience Meta Learner Agent (best-site behavior extraction)
- Content Originality Guard Agent (anti-derivative safety layer)
- Full end-to-end dry-run documentation for Site-01

Reason:
Address concerns that AI-generated sites may feel generic,
low-quality, or mechanically repetitive.

Impact:
- Site experience is now independent from content quality
- Poor UX patterns are detected, remembered, and prevented
- System learns what “good site experience” means over time
- Long-term quality improves without human micromanagement

Risk:
- Increased system complexity
- Slower initial iteration speed

Mitigation:
- Conservative defaults
- Advisory-first agents
- Legal and QA veto preserved

Status:
ACTIVE
