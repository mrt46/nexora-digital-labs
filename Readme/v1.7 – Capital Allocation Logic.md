# Version v1.7 – Multi-Site Portfolio Strategy
## Operating a Portfolio, Not a Collection

This document describes how the platform behaves
when scaling from 10 to 50 active sites.

The goal is not to grow sites.
The goal is to manage a **portfolio of assets**.

---

## From Sites to Portfolio Thinking

At small scale, each site feels unique.
At scale, uniqueness becomes noise.

Beyond 10 sites, decisions are no longer site-centric.
They are **portfolio-centric**.

What matters is:
- aggregate stability
- risk distribution
- capital efficiency

---

## Portfolio Segmentation Model

Sites are grouped into behavioral tiers:

- **Exploration Tier**  
  New or unproven sites. High uncertainty, low commitment.

- **Core Tier**  
  Stable, monetized sites. Revenue backbone.

- **Scale Tier**  
  High-performing sites eligible for cloning.

- **Asset Tier**  
  Mature, predictable sites optimized for holding or exit.

Each site belongs to exactly one tier at any time.

---

## Expected Distribution (10 → 50 Sites)

A healthy portfolio trends toward:

- 30–40% Exploration
- 30–40% Core
- 10–20% Scale
- 10–15% Asset

This distribution prevents:
- over-experimentation
- over-optimization
- revenue fragility

---

## Portfolio-Level Decision Making

Decisions are made using:
- tier-level signals
- cross-site comparisons
- marginal return analysis

No site is protected by sentiment.
No site is punished by novelty.

---

## Risk Isolation at Scale

Failures are expected.
Correlation is not.

The portfolio is designed so that:
- one site failing does not impact others
- one niche collapse does not cascade
- one platform change does not wipe revenue

Diversity is structural, not accidental.

---

## Governance at Portfolio Level

Governance reviews:
- tier distribution
- capital flow between tiers
- concentration risk

Governance does not review individual pages or tactics.

---

## Why This Strategy Works

Portfolios outperform collections because:
- risk is priced
- success is replicated
- failure is cheap

At 50 sites, the system is no longer “growing”.
It is **allocating attention**.

# Version v1.7 – Capital Allocation Logic
## Deciding Where Money and Attention Go

This document defines how capital (time, compute, budget)
is allocated across sites and tiers.

The goal is not fairness.
The goal is **return-adjusted efficiency**.

---

## Capital Is More Than Money

In this system, capital includes:
- content budget
- compute usage
- automation frequency
- human attention (rare)

All capital is finite.
All allocation is intentional.

---

## Allocation Principles

1. Capital follows signal, not hope  
2. Stability is rewarded before growth  
3. Exploration is capped by design  
4. No site is entitled to capital  

---

## Tier-Based Allocation Rules

### Exploration Tier
- strict budget caps
- limited content velocity
- fast kill thresholds

Goal: discover signal cheaply.

---

### Core Tier
- stable budgets
- consistent automation
- optimization allowed but limited

Goal: protect revenue base.

---

### Scale Tier
- increased budgets
- cloning evaluation
- efficiency optimization

Goal: replicate success safely.

---

### Asset Tier
- minimal spend
- maintenance-only actions
- maximum predictability

Goal: preserve value.

---

## Capital Rebalancing Cycle

Capital is rebalanced periodically based on:
- performance deltas
- risk signals
- portfolio distribution drift

Rebalancing is mechanical, not emotional.

---

## Starvation and Overfunding Prevention

Two failure modes are explicitly avoided:
- starving promising sites
- overfunding declining ones

Caps and floors exist for every tier.

---

## Governance Oversight

Governance reviews:
- allocation summaries
- concentration risk
- systemic drift

Governance does not micromanage spend.

---

## Why This Logic Matters

Most systems fail by:
- chasing outliers
- ignoring opportunity cost
- confusing activity with progress

This logic enforces discipline.

# Version v1.7 – Sunset & Decommission Protocol
## Killing Sites Safely and Intentionally

This document defines how sites are retired,
decommissioned, or removed from the portfolio.

The goal is not mercy.
The goal is **capital preservation**.

---

## Why Killing Sites Is Necessary

Keeping bad sites alive:
- drains capital
- pollutes data
- distorts decisions

Sunsetting is not failure.
It is portfolio hygiene.

---

## Sunset Triggers

A site becomes a sunset candidate if:
- sustained underperformance persists
- risk profile increases
- opportunity cost becomes unjustifiable

Triggers are signal-based, not time-based.

---

## Sunset States

A site progresses through:

1. **FROZEN**  
   No new content. Monitoring only.

2. **DEPRECATED**  
   Monetization removed. Minimal maintenance.

3. **DECOMMISSIONED**  
   Infrastructure shut down. Domain retained.

4. **RETIRED**  
   Asset archived or sold.

Not all sites reach the final state.

---

## Data and Asset Handling

Before decommissioning:
- data is archived
- learnings are extracted
- brand assets are secured

Nothing valuable is discarded blindly.

---

## Legal and Brand Considerations

Sunsetting includes:
- removing misleading content
- disabling monetization
- preventing brand confusion

Legal cleanliness matters even at death.

---

## Governance Role

Governance approves:
- irreversible shutdowns
- asset sales
- brand retirements

Execution remains automated.

---

## Why This Protocol Protects Value

Systems that cannot kill assets
accumulate invisible debt.

This protocol ensures:
- clarity
- discipline
- long-term efficiency

---

## Closing Note on Decommissioning

A healthy system knows when to stop.

Ending things well
is as important as starting them well.
