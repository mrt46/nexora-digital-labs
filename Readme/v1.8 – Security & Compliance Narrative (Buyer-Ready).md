# Version v1.8 – Security & Compliance Narrative
## Explaining Trust to People Who Did Not Build the System

This document explains how security and compliance
are approached from a buyer’s perspective.

The goal is not to claim perfect security.
The goal is to demonstrate **controlled, reasonable risk**.

---

## Security as a Confidence Signal

Buyers do not expect zero incidents.
They expect that incidents:
- are detected
- are contained
- do not spiral

Security in this system is designed to inspire confidence,
not fear.

---

## Minimal Attack Surface by Design

The platform minimizes exposure by:
- limiting external integrations
- isolating sites logically
- centralizing orchestration

There are fewer doors,
and every door is visible.

---

## Access Control Philosophy

Access is:
- role-based
- minimal by default
- revocable instantly

No agent has more permission than required.
Humans do not have operational shortcuts.

---

## Automation Credential Safety

Automation credentials:
- are scoped per function
- are rotated
- are never shared across sites

A compromised credential cannot collapse the system.

---

## Compliance by Architecture, Not Policy

Compliance is achieved structurally:
- data locality is respected
- logs are append-only
- decisions are traceable

There is no reliance on human memory or good intent.

---

## Incident Visibility

Security incidents:
- emit events
- trigger freezes when required
- are logged permanently

Nothing is hidden.
Nothing is silently patched.

---

## Why This Matters to Buyers

From a buyer’s perspective:
- unknown risk is expensive
- documented risk is manageable

This narrative exists to reduce uncertainty,
not to impress.

---

## Closing Note on Security

Security is not a feature.
It is a posture.

This system chooses a conservative posture,
and documents it clearly.

# Version v1.8 – Disaster Recovery & Continuity Model
## Surviving the Worst Without Heroics

This document defines how the platform survives
unexpected failures and external disruptions.

The goal is continuity,
not perfection.

---

## Assumption of Failure

The system assumes that:
- servers will fail
- providers will have outages
- humans will make mistakes

Resilience is designed, not hoped for.

---

## Failure Domains

Failures are isolated into domains:
- single site
- infrastructure layer
- automation layer
- external dependency

No failure is allowed to cross domains unchecked.

---

## Backup Philosophy

Backups are:
- automated
- verified
- boring

The system prefers:
- fewer backups that work
- over many backups that are untested

---

## Recovery Priorities

Recovery order is explicit:
1. Preserve data
2. Restore orchestration
3. Restore core sites
4. Restore exploration sites

Not everything is equal.
Not everything is urgent.

---

## Human Role in Recovery

Humans:
- may initiate recovery
- may approve irreversible steps
- do not debug under pressure

The system favors calm recovery
over fast reaction.

---

## Continuity Over Speed

A slow recovery that is predictable
is preferred over a fast one that is chaotic.

---

## Closing Note on Continuity

Disasters test systems.
Good systems survive.
Great systems remain understandable afterward.

# Version v1.8 – Key-Person Risk Elimination
## Designing a System That Outlives Its Builder

This document explains how dependency on any single individual
is systematically removed.

The goal is transferability.

---

## Why Key-Person Risk Destroys Value

From a buyer’s perspective,
a system that requires a specific person
is not a system.
It is a job.

Jobs do not scale.
Assets do.

---

## Knowledge as Code

All critical knowledge is:
- documented
- versioned
- stored centrally

There are no “things only one person knows”.

---

## Decision Traceability

Every important decision:
- has a reason
- has a timestamp
- has an owner

Nothing depends on memory.

---

## No Manual Rituals

If something requires:
- intuition
- personal judgment
- repeated manual steps

It is considered unfinished.

---

## Replaceability as a Design Constraint

Every role:
- can be replaced
- can be paused
- can be removed

The system does not ask who is present.
It asks what rules apply.

---

## Human Absence Test

The system must function if:
- the founder is unavailable
- no intervention occurs for extended periods

If it does not, it fails this test.

---

## Closing Note on Key-Person Risk

The ultimate proof of a finished system
is that it no longer needs its creator.
